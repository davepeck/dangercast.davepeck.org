            <p>It&#146;s been a while since I&#146;ve checked in on drum'n'bass. All but dead in the US, the style lives
                on every street corner in London. Listening to new artists and tracks, I discern a bit of a bifurcation:
                there&#146;s the old d'n'b: euphoric, uplifting, sometimes overrun by cheesy vocals. And there&#146;s a
                new sound emerging: dark, with brutal cutting bass lines. Being more nostalgic for the former, I cranked
                out this old-skool mix full of party times but cut with dark interludes and capped with a pensive mood.
                The skies are indeed wide.</p>
