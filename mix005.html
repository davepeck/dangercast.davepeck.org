			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Jazz is a funny genre. It lost its cultural
				cachet quite some time ago -- long enough ago for the
				music to move underground and evolve. But even in 2009, Jazz
				is still struggling; it is still looking for its way.</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>There
				are those who are content to rehash the sounds of the
				past; there are those who seek to innovate. I'm focusing
				on the innovators here, but it should be said that there
				is <em>so much</em> innovation that it is impossible to
				capture even a tiny slice of it in a short podcast such as
				this.</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Jazz musicians are
				pushing boundaries with new forms, new combinations of
				instruments, and by merging the music they know with
				exotic sounds from other genres: minimalist
				classical, traditional Indian, Klezmer, and abstract
				electronic all have a part to play.</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>This mix
				is the "edge": it's what's on the frontier if you take
				the classic bop- and Davis-era recordings as your
				waypoints. In a future mix, perhaps, I'll show what lies
				beyond that edge -- music from the modern netherworld of
				jazz where true chaos reigns.</p>
